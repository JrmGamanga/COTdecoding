# COT Decoding

This project is part of MVA’s LLM course. The goal was to reproduce the findings of the original paper and, following the authors’ approach, conduct experiments to evaluate the influence of COT decoding on the accuracy of LLMs in reasoning tasks. In addition to the COT decoding method proposed by the authors, we also experimented with alternatives using beam search and sampling.

The core code is available in the **src** folder, and the experimental notebook can be found in the main folder.
